# JokeGenerator
## Project
This app was created in order to test out Angular.

## Functionalities
There are currently three pages: Home, Single Joke and Joke list.
Potential future features may include a backend, in order to save favorite jokes and upload your own, gradually weaning off of the JokeApi.

## Technologies
Angular CLI, Bootstrap and the JokeAPI (https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/) were used.
